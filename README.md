# What is this project?

This project is an app focused around sustainability by gamifying completing sustainable tasks.

When creating an account users will be presented with a choice of buddies, to be their eco friendly companion in the app.

Users will complete tasks to earn EcoCoins, our eco currency, which can be spent on items to decorate their buddy, or play games with them.

# Project layout 
We have 4 apps:
- under_my_scrum_brella: home, index, games and my pet
- Users: account, friends, leaderboard, login, signup 
- Item: shop, wardrobe
- Task: tasks 
Each app contains the relevant models to store data
